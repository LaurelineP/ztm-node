		<h1>ðŸ“ˆ Blocking server ( no demo )</h1>
		<h2>DING DING DING !</h2>
		<p>Accessing this page triggers a loop where Node cannot delegates to other process as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>it is not a request that v8 should handle</li>
				<li>it is not some file to process with libuv</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This is the main process handling the pure JavaScript.</p>
		<p>The experience was to open twice this very page: then refresh
			both tab as quick as possible <br>--> through the Inspector Network we can observe <br>
			that their first state ( as request ) is pending; then the first refreshed tab is done<br>
			Finally, it is <u>only when the first tab refreshed is done that the server process the
			second process</u><br> --> <u>means there are pended while first task has been processed / kept pending 
			because of the loop effect</u>
