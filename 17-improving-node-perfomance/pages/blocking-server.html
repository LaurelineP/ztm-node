	<h1>ðŸ“ˆ Blocking server ( no demo )</h1>
	<h2>DING DING DING !</h2>
	<details open>
		<summary>Implementation</summary>
		<p>Accessing this page triggers a loop where Node cannot delegates to other process as:
		- it is not a request that v8 should handle
		- it is not some file to process with libuv
		This is the main process handling the pure javascript.</p>
		<p>The experience was to open twice this very page: then refresh 
			both tab as quick as possible --> we can observe that their first state are pending
			then the first refreshed tab is done
			finally it is only when the first tab refreshed is done that the server process the
			second process --> == pended while first task has been processed / kept pending 
			because of the loop effect
